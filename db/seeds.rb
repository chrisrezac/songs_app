# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# songs = Song.create(
#   [
#     { 
#       title: "The Woods", 
#       album: "The Boy Who Cried Wolf",
#       artist: "Olivver the Kid", 
#       year: "2015"
#     },
#     {
